# rails-react

A simple way to get React up and running with Rails without the need for a gem. Uses ES6 and Webpack.

When building my first Rails app with a React frontend, I came across many different ways of integrating both. Some quite complex, some simpler, most using the [react-rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) gem. 

I wanted to keep the React side of things completely independent of Rails, so using the gem was something I wanted to avoid. 

## What's inside

* A blank rails app generated by `rails new` 
* A React frontend in the `frontend` folder
* HomeController#index renders a div where the React frontend is placed
* Webpack is used to generate the `public/javascripts/bundle.js` file

## Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:theplastictoy/rails-react.git
cd rails-react
npm install webpack -g
npm install
webpack
rails s
```

If you want to keep webpack running to auto-detect changes in js files:

    webpack -w

## Contributing

This is a quite simple setup of React in a Rails app. If there are better ways to do it, please contribute.
